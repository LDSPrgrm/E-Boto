### Database administrator can just edit the number of votes? How would you handle that?

Database administrators typically have the technical ability to access and modify data within a database, including vote counts. To prevent unauthorized or malicious alterations to voting data, several measures can be implemented:

-   Access Control: Limiting access to the database and segregating duties so that only authorized personnel can make changes to sensitive information like vote counts.
-   Audit Trails: Implementing audit trails that track all changes made to the database, including modifications to vote tallies. This allows for accountability and transparency in case of any discrepancies.
-   Encryption: Encrypting sensitive data within the database can add an extra layer of security, making it more difficult for unauthorized individuals to tamper with vote counts.
-   Regular Monitoring: Conducting regular monitoring of database activities to detect any unusual patterns or unauthorized access attempts that could indicate tampering with voting data.
-   Dual Control Principle: Implementing a dual control principle where critical operations, such as modifying vote counts, require approval from multiple authorized individuals before changes are made.
    By implementing these security measures and following best practices in database administration, organizations can help mitigate the risk of unauthorized alterations to voting data by administrators.
